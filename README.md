# Melody

It's a simple application using UITableViewController and UINavigationController. 

First Screen is "SingersListViewController" which reads "songs.plist" file to display list of singers and their images. 
When user clicks on a particular singer, he lands on "SongsListTableViewController" where he can see all the songs of that particular singer. 

Future work: 
1. add audio files and play button in front of a particular song 
2. Add lyrics button so that user can read the lyrics while listening to music
